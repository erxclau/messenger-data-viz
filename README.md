## Instructions

### Getting Data From Facebook

1. Open Facebook and click on "Settings" or "Settings and Privacy".
2. Click on "Your Facebook Information".
3. Click on "Download Your Information".
4. Deselect all options in "Your Information" except for "Messages".
5. Select a date range for the messages you would like to analyze.
6. Select JSON as the format.
7. Select low media quality to reduce the file size of images and videos.
8. Click "Create File".
9. Facebook will send you two emails: one confirming that you requested for data and another one alerting you when your file has been created. This may take several minutes.
10. Click on the "Available Copies" tab to download your data. The folder will be called `facebook-<YOUR_USERNAME>` These copies expire four days after they are created.
11. Extract the files from the downloaded zipped folder.

For reference, when I downloaded around 8 years of data, I ended up with over 2 gigabytes of data.

### Setting Up Your Python Environment

- Download a version of python3 and pip.
- To prevent conflicts with globally installed packages, it is recommended to run everything in a virtual environment.

#### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

- Run `python -V` or `python3 -V` and in the following steps, use the python command that says you are using a version of python3.
- Run `python -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment.
- Enter your virtual environment by running:
  - **Windows**:
    - Make sure your terminal allows you to execute scripts. Read about Execution Policies [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7).
    - `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
  - **Linux or macOS**:
    - `. venv/bin/activate`
- To exit your virtual environment, run `deactivate`.

#### Installing Dependencies

- Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your virtual environment:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Using Your Data

- Move the `messages` folder from `facebook-<YOUR_USERNAME>` into the root level of this repository.
- The script will only analyze messages in the `inbox` folder (i.e. not `archived_threads` or `message_requests`).
  - If you'd like to analyze `archived_threads` or `message_requests` too, simply move the conversation folders inside those folders into `inbox`.
  - If there are conversations you do not want to analyze, move them out of `inbox` or delete them.
- Run the following commands in your virtual environment
  - `python analyze.py`
  - This may take several seconds depending on how much data you have.
  - `python -m http.server --directory src`
- Go to <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>.
